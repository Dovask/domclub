Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

### Header 3

```python
# Python code with syntax highlighting
def say_hello(name):
    """Print hello message"""
    print(f'Hello {name}')

```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end

```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

#### Header 4

{:.nes-list .is-disc}
*   This is an unordered list following a header.

1.  This is an ordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

This is how a table should look like.

{:.nes-table .is-bordered}
| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |
| ok           | good `zoute` drop | yumm  |

There's a horizontal rule below this.
